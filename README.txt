===================
Print Table Module
===================

The primary purpose of this package is to print out Gurobi variables in the console
as tables.

The PrintTable class takes data as a 2-tuple key, (row, col).

There are optional arguments for headers and labels. There is a dimensions arg, but
I might automate this in the future.

Run the following command to install
> pip install git+https://github.com/MrRobboWilliamson/print-table.git#egg=printtable
